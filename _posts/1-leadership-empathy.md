### Introduction 

I've been told I should begin blogging again and talking about technical items to increase my personal brand. I've also been told I should build out my soft skills and leadership skills. I used to do both of these things, but time, etc. Blogging and the Tech experimentation I used to do kind of fell by the way-side.

In the future I plan to blog about things such as deploying Kubernetes on Chromeboxes, Mobile Application Automation, Writing X-Platform Tools, etc. Some cool topics in the pipeline. But today i'd like to go over the topic of Empathy and Leadership. I feel like many go over "Leadership Qualities" but never dive deep into why empathy is the ingrediant in all of those values.

### Empathy Empowers Employees
Two years ago, while working at Red Hat, My father was admitted to the hospital in critical condition. This wasn't a case of "Oh, he has X, we need to do Y". For him, this was a case of "Oh, we don't know why he's sick." Unfortunately for my father, he never left that Hospital, and he never got the Burger King Whopper he so desparately wanted. It was a terrible and sudden event that lasted over two months before he finally got rest.

This is something that every person will have to experience in their life, the loss of a family member or friend. Sometimes it may happen abruptly, and other times it may happen in a drawn out fashion as mine did. This isn't something that may happen, but it is an absolute that will happen. Like me that person will be forced to call their manager and explain the situation. They'll have the fear of that talk not going well and meeting as a response of "Well, when can we expect you in tomorrow?", "How does this affect the project", or a question of "Will I still get paid?"  etc.

*Go take care of what you need, I'll handle everything from here and let the client know. I'll make sure everything is handled. Don't worry about it, take your time, call me when you're ready to come back.*

The above was my manager's statement, almost verbatim. I remember that exact phone call two years later because to me it was shocking. I was absolutely dumbfounded, I expected a fight, or worse. In the end, I spent time by my father's side and worked when I could. When he passed away, I took a short amount of time returned.

When I returned, nothing at work had changed. My role was the same, my responsibilities were the same, my tasks were the same. This was instramental in my healing process. Having lost my father and having my world turned upside down, the one thing I never had to worry about was my job and role there-in. It was a form of structure that I needed.

### The Outcome

Because of my manager's response and actions, I was able to heal quickly and not be stressed about the reprecusions of my departure. This in turn left me with a strong desire to give my manager 110% effort. Not only because I wanted to repay him for his empathy, but because I respected him and wanted to make sure I did right by him.

In one swift move, he not only gained my **respect**, my **allegiance**, and my **trust**. But he showed me that he was deserving of such things.

After this, I found that not only did I work harder for him. But I felt a strong desire to solve issues before they reached him. I felt I could take risks and make decisions because he would have my back. This lead to me being a better employee and member of his team. It lead to me growing as a person and carrying that growth into the workplace where I could translate it into growth for the company and my team. 


### Finding Empathy

I have many other stories with this employer. I'll save them for another day, I'm writing this today because recently i've decided I need to grow more and have decided to seek a new role.

During my search for a new role, I interviewed with a number of companies. I believe the number was around 8-9? This last week I was in the final round of interviews with 3 of them, and one of those three decided to offer me a position with their company.

The manager at this employer during the interviews was warm, personable, and kind. Yes, he was all business. But he was *other things too*. Picking a new role for a new company is not something I do often. However his actions and speech stood out to me.

When given the offer letter, He was excited to have me join; despite only meeting me a few times. I informed him that I needed to speak with my current employer, as they had found out about the offer and I had given them a promise to speak before accepting. (Empathy goes both ways). 

He was visibly saddened by this. I informed him I did not plan to accept a counter, and that I do not compete offers against each other. (*I really don't*) However, I do something different, as a litmus test; I judge the reactions of those being given the bad news.

His response was very similar to my employer when I got their counter. "We hope you decide to stay with us/take this offer. We think you'll do great things here, and we can do great things together. We really want you here. But we entirely understand if you don't."

This wasn't a canned response, this was from my current manager and my future manager; and it was an empathetic and heartfelt statement on their half.

*Ah, But what about those other folks you say?*

The first, I e-mailed them as it was early in their locale. I thanked them for their time, I told them I hope they find the best canidate possible. I wrote what I thought to be a decent letter. *They straight ghosted me.* No thank you, Nothing.

The second? The recruiting company's account manager for them called me and had a 15 minute conversation with me. I've had better conversations with car salesman. It was a hard sell, and I informed them I would respond to the offer letter by end of business. That I had given them my word I would. 

*"Well, What's the worst they're going to do if you just tell them three more days. People do it all the time to us."*

Even after informing them of my promise and intent. Instead of saying "I'm sorry we can't get the final interview with you in that timeframe. I hope you'll find happiness in your new role." - They scheduled me for an interview with the client *days* after I was due to accept the offer.

### The Offer

I accepted the offer with the new company that day. Not because it was better. In-fact, the base pay was **double digit percentage points lower** than some of the other positions I was applying for. A fact the manager himself identified during the interview.

I accepted the offer with that company; Because they showed me empathy. They treated me like a human being, and not a 2018 Honda Accord with sweet rims. Because of this, I know they will empower me to do my best work, and support me on my path.
